# Doggy (iOS/Android/Desktop/HTML5)
## Summary
This game's mechanic is almost just like the famous Chrome offline dinosaur game. The goal of the game is to jump over obstacles just by tapping. It sounds easy, but timing plays a huge role into the gameplay.

This project utilizes the low level and open source development framework called LibGDX. The framework gives the project many higher level tools to efficiently create the game without re-inventing the wheel while having full access to the low level API in case you need to look at the code source. 

## Prerequisites
This project requires Java 8+.
All dependencies are managed automatically by Gradle.
Java IDE (preferably Android Studio since it easily deals with the Gradle build system in my experience) 

## Built With
LibGDX - Java Cross-Platform Development
Gradle - Dependency Management

## License
This project is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 - see the LICENSE.md file for details.
